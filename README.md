# pts-projects-repo

A lightweight scaffold for PTS styled projects. This repo collects the demos and walkthroughs used for interview prep and contains starter files for the monitoring and ops projects.

Included (scaffold):

- project-1-monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana compose and example config (see pts-projects/ for fuller scaffolding).
- project-2-service-watcher: PowerShell and Bash watcher scripts.
